Picaßo is an innovative mobile application designed to offer users a daily dose of inspiration through notable artworks and their compelling narratives. Our mission is to make art accessible and enjoyable for everyone, regardless of their background or expertise.

* Favorite artworks, artists, movements and museums to save them for later.
* Shuffle through artworks, artists, movements and museums to explore different pieces randomly.
* Filter and search through the entire collection of them.
